# GUI Calculator

This Python program is a basic graphical user interface (GUI) calculator created using the Tkinter library. It provides a simple interface for performing arithmetic calculations.

## Features

- Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
- Support for parentheses to specify the order of operations.
- Clear (C) and backspace (‚Üê) buttons for modifying input.
- Accurate mathematical evaluation of expressions.
- User-friendly interface with buttons for input and result display.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the program by executing `main.py`.

3. The calculator GUI window will appear, allowing you to perform calculations.

4. Use the mouse to click the buttons for digits, operators, and actions (clear, backspace, equals).

5. You can also use the keyboard for input:
   - Press "Enter" to calculate the result.
   - Press "Backspace" to delete the last character.
   - Press keys (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), parentheses (,), and decimal point (.) to enter expressions.

6. The calculator evaluates mathematical expressions accurately, following the standard order of operations.

7. The result of the calculation is displayed in the entry field at the top of the GUI.

## Customize and Extend

- You can customize the appearance and layout of the GUI by modifying constants like `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `X`, and `Y` in the code.

- To add more functionality or features to the calculator, you can extend the code by creating additional buttons or functions.

- The code provides a foundation for building more advanced calculator applications with additional mathematical functions, memory features, and scientific calculations.

## Dependencies

- This program relies on the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations, for creating the GUI.

## Notes

- This calculator is intended for basic arithmetic calculations and educational purposes.
- You can adapt and enhance this code to create more advanced calculators with scientific, engineering, or financial functionality.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs and preferences.

Enjoy using the GUI calculator!
